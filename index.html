          <p>Currently featured in the exterior model:</p>
          <ul>

          <p>Note that at this time, the exterior texture is

          <p>The Piper Archer CX has been tested extensively with
            Rembrandt and atmospheric light scattering; the aircraft
            should work well with either one enabled. All of the lights
            will dim when the electrical system is under load, such as
            when the starter is cranking the engine.</p>
          <p>The following lights fully support Rembrandt lighting:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><span>Cockpit lighting</span></li>
            <li><span>Landing lights</span></li>
            <li><span>Navigation lights</span></li>

          <header>Detailed cockpit</header>
          <p>The fictional Piper Archer CX, unlike the existing TX and
            LX variants, has analog instruments (such as in the Piper
            Archer II) instead of a glass panel. Each instrument is
            modeled to fit the instrument panel and should mimic its
            real-life counterpart as closely as possible.</p>
          <p>The following instruments are present:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><span>Flight instruments (six pack)</span></li>
            <li><span>Oil temperature / oil pressure</span></li>
            <li><span>Battery voltage</span></li>
            <li><span>Fuel level / fuel pressure</span></li>
            <li><span>Tachometer</span></li>
          </ul>
          <p>In addition to the above instruments, many switches and
            controls are present as well.</p>

          <header>Recommended installation</header>
          <p>If you know how to use Git, it's highly recommended
            to clone the repository and use it directly:
            <code>git clone http://github.com/zlsa/pa28-181.git</code>
            and pull once a day or so. <code>master</code> will
            occasionally have graphical problems or minor bugs but
            should always fly.
          </p>
          <p>If you use the zip downloaded here, be aware that this
            aircraft is updated almost daily and you will have to
            remove the aircraft, download the zip, and unpack it
            whenever you want the newer changes.</p>

          <header>Versions</header>
          <p>Previous releases are not guaranteed to work in any way;
            use at your own risk. Older versions and newer version are
            not compatible. This aircraft has been tested with
            FlightGear version 3.0 and should work with 3.2 as
            well.</p>
