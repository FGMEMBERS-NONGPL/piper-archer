          <p>The exterior model features fully animated flight control
            surfaces and landing gear with struts and scissors.</p>
          <p>Currently featured in the exterior model:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><span>Ailerons, elevator, and rudder</span></li>
            <li><span>Elevator trim tab</span></li>
            <li><span>Landing gear suspension</span></li>

            <li><span>Propeller with blur</span></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Note that at this time, the exterior texture is
            provisional; the tail number and the livery cannot be
            changed.</p>

          <header>Lighting</header>
          <p>The Piper Archer has been tested extensively with
            Rembrandt and atmospheric light scattering; the aircraft
            should work well with either one enabled. All of the lights
            will dim when the electrical system is under load, such as
            when the starter is cranking the engine.</p>
          <p>The following lights fully support Rembrandt lighting:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><span>Cockpit lighting</span></li>
            <li><span>Landing lights</span></li>
            <li><span>Navigation lights</span></li>
            <li><span>Strobe lights</span></li>
            <li><span>Tail beacon light</span></li>

        <section id="cockpit">
          <header>Detailed cockpit</header>
          <p>The fictional Piper Archer CX, unlike the existing TX and
            LX variants, has analog instruments (such as in the Piper
            Archer II) instead of a glass panel. Each instrument is
            modeled to fit the instrument panel and should mimic its
            real-life counterpart as closely as possible.</p>
          <p>The following instruments are present:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><span>Flight instruments (six pack)</span></li>
            <li><span>Oil temperature / oil pressure</span></li>
            <li><span>Battery voltage</span></li>
            <li><span>Fuel level / fuel pressure</span></li>
            <li><span>Tachometer</span></li>
          </ul>
          <p>In addition to the above instruments, many switches and
            controls are present as well.</p>

        <section id="effects">
          <header>Advanced effects</header>
          <p>FlightGear's effects offer a high degree of realism, but
          only if they're used by aircraft. The Piper Archer series
          showcases many effects possible in later versions of
          FlightGear.</p>
          <p>The following effects have been implemented:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><span>Frost and rain on windshield</span></li>
            <li><span>Fake shadows (in progress)</span></li>
            <li><span>Advanced fuselage shading with reflections and normal map (in progress)</span></li>
          </ul>
          <p>As FlightGear's effects improve, the Piper Archer's effects will be updated as well.</p>

          <header>Recommended installation</header>
          <p>If you know how to use Git, it's highly recommended
            to clone the repository and use it directly:
            <code>git clone http://github.com/zlsa/piper-archer-cx.git</code>
            and pull once a day or so. <code>master</code> will
            occasionally have graphical problems or minor bugs but
            should always fly.
          </p>
          <p>If you use the zip downloaded here, be aware that this
            aircraft is updated almost daily<a title="Sort of; I've
            been away from FlightGear for a while so this aircraft has
            stagnated.">*</a> and you will have to remove the
            aircraft, download the zip, and unpack it whenever you
            want the newer changes.</p>

          <header>Versions</header>
          <p>Previous releases are not guaranteed to work in any way;
            use at your own risk. Older versions and newer version are
            not compatible. This aircraft has been tested with
            FlightGear version 3.5 (git) and should work with 3.2 and
            3.4 as well.</p>
