# License

Will be CC0 when released; currently GPLV2 due to some textures.

Currently, `Engines/prop.xml` is made up of AndersG's propeller values. This will be fixed soon.

Note that the entire `References` directory is not part of the
aircraft and is copyrighted by many people. I am saving it here only
to avoid having to search for them every time.
