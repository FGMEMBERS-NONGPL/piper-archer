# Status (Alpha)

## FDM _1/5_ (Flyable)

JSBSim. Modified from Aeromatic with correct bogey locations (three
wheels and wingtips) and tweaked engine and lift/drag settings.

## Systems _1/5_ (None at all)

JSBSim engine starts and stops. Flaps work.

## Cockpit _2/5_ (Major instruments only)

_Please note that I will hand-model every instrument to match the real
life one as closely as possible._

Normal-mapped instrument panel. Currently flyable (all six major instruments are in place). Throttle
quadrant and yokes are animated, as are all gauges.

## Model: _2/5_ (Animated gear)

_The model is currently medium-poly, with about 3 verts per 90 degree
round corner on the model._

The door is modeled (but not animated). The gear is modeled and animated with proper reflective materials.
