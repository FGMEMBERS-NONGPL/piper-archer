# About

simulator.

# Status

FDM: 0/5
Systems: 1/5
Cockpit: 2/5
Model: 1/5
__Overall__: Alpha

## FDM _0/5_

JSBSim. Direct from Aeromatic with correct bogey locations (three
wheels and wingtips) and engine settings. Currently unflyable and the
engine cannot start unless the throttle is increased to about 1/3.

## Systems _1/5_

JSBSim engine starts and stops. Flaps work (but I don't know what they
do yet in JSBSim :P).

## Cockpit _2/5_

_Please note that I will hand-model every instrument to match the real
life one as closely as possible._

Normal-mapped instrument panel. Currently flyable (all major instruments are in place). Throttle
quadrant and yokes are animated, as are all gauges.

## Model: _1/5_

_The model is currently medium-poly, with about 3 verts per 90 degree
round corner on the model._

The engine area is a bit wonky (incorrect shape). The door is modeled
(but not animated). The gear is modeled and animated with proper reflective materials.
